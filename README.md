# Beginner AI Projects 🤖✨

A beginner-friendly **AI project series** built with **Python**, **LangChain**, and **OpenAI**.

This repository documents my journey learning AI by building **real, working projects**  not just tutorials. Each project is small, focused, and designed to help beginners understand AI concepts through hands-on practice.

If you’re new to AI or feel overwhelmed by where to start, this series is for you.

## 🔐 Environment Variables (Important)

Each project that requires API keys includes a `.env.example` file inside its folder.

To run a project:
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Add your own API key
3. Never commit `.env` — it is ignored by Git
